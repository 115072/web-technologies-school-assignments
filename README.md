# 🎓 School Projects (Web Development)

These are some of my past school projects where I learned the **basics of web development and web design** from scratch.  
The focus of these projects was on building a foundation in creating websites and understanding how different technologies connect together.

## 📚 What I Learned
- 🌐 HTML & CSS – building page structure and styling  
- 🎨 Web Design – layouts, responsive design, and Bootstrap  
- ⚡ JavaScript – adding interactivity  
- 🐘 PHP – server-side basics and connecting to databases  
- 🔑 Forms & Login Systems – handling input, sessions, and authentication  
- 🗄️ Databases – storing and retrieving data

## ⚠️ Important Note
Most of these projects may **not work out-of-the-box** anymore, since they require a server environment to run (PHP/MySQL).  
However, the **source code is still available** for reference and learning purposes.

## 💡 Purpose
These projects represent my first steps into web development. They may not be perfect, but they showcase the skills and concepts I practiced during my studies.
